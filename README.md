# Connect-Four
The Java code implements a classic Connect Four game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using buttons and images. The game is designed to be played by two players, taking turns to drop their images (Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) into a 6x7 grid. The objective of the game is to connect four images of the same color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
